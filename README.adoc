**Choreography-driven static site generator in Anvomidav.**

_Let sequences flow. Let transitions compile. Let pages perform._

== Who This Is For

* Developers exploring **domain-specific languages** applied to unconventional problems
* Those who appreciate how **artistic structure** can inform software architecture
* Programmers curious about **Anvomidav**—the first language for figure skating choreography
* Anyone seeking a static site generator that treats content as **performance art**

== Rationale

=== Sequences as Programs

In figure skating, a program is a precise sequence of elements—jumps, spins, footwork—each with defined entry and exit transitions. Anvomidav formalizes this: every page build is a _program_, every content transformation a _choreographed element_.

=== Transitions Compile to Links

Choreographers think in transitions—how one element flows into the next. In vladik-ssg, navigation and linking emerge from transition declarations. The connection between pages isn't metadata; it's **choreographic intent**.

=== Scores as Type System

Figure skating judges evaluate technical elements and program components. Anvomidav's type system mirrors this duality: content must satisfy both _technical requirements_ (valid markup, proper structure) and _artistic components_ (flow, coherence, expression).

=== Performance as Output

The final site is a _performance_. Just as a skating program exists only in its execution on ice, a vladik-ssg site exists as the rendered experience. The source choreography compiles to audience-ready pages.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/vladik-ssg
cd vladik-ssg

# Enter development environment
guix shell -D -f guix.scm

# Build the site (compile the program)
just build

# Serve locally (rehearsal mode)
just serve
